# BMG250 Sensor API

> This package contains BMG250 sensor API

## Sensor Overview
The BMG250 is an ultra-small, digital 3-axis angular rate sensor with a flexible measurement range from 125°/s up to 2000°/s (dps) and a high digital resolution of 16 bit that provides a precise low noise angular rate (gyroscopic) measurement at market leading low power consumption. With its secondary 3-wire, 10 MHz SPI interface it is optimized for image stabilization duties in parallel to standard user interface applications. It has been designed for low power, high precision multi-axis user-interface applications (UI) parallel to optical- or electronic image stabilization (OIS & EIS) in mobile phones, tablets, camera modules and head-mounted devices. Parallel OIS / EIS UI functionality is mandatory in use-case scenarios like Panorama panning image.
